# Annotate your time series with LabelStudio
Amazon Lookout for Equipment uses the data from your sensors to detect abnormal 
equipment behavior, so you can take action before machine failures occur and 
avoid unplanned downtime. Lookout for Equipment only uses unsupervised approaches
and doesn't need any label to provide valuable insights. Yet, knowing past time
ranges where something went wrong can help increase the forewarning time Lookout
for Equipment can provide before an actual event of interest.
